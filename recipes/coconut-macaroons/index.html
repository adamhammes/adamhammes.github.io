<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>3 cups sweetened, shredded coconut</li>
<li>4 large egg whites</li>
<li>&frac12; cup sugar</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla or almond extract</li>
<li>&frac14; teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F</li>
<li>For deeper coconut flavor and extra-crispy macaroons, spread the coconut on the baking sheet and toast for about 5 minutes, or until just barely starting to show some color.
Let cool slightly before using.</li>
<li>Combine the egg whites, sugar, vanilla, and salt in a mixing bowl.
Whisk until the whites and sugar are completely combined and the mixture is frothy.</li>
<li>Pour the coconut over the egg white mixture and stir until the coconut is evenly moistened.</li>
<li>Line the baking sheet with parchment.
With wet hands to prevent sticking, shape the coconut mixture into small balls about 1 &frac12;-inches in diameter.
Space them an inch or so apart on the baking sheet.</li>
<li>Bake the macaroons until golden, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Let the macaroons cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
Macaroons can be kept in an airtight container for up to a week.</li>
</ol>

<p>For a nice combination, add blackberry jelly.
Before baking, make indentation in the tops with your thumb and put in a small amount of jelly.</p>
