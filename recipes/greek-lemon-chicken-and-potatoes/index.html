<li>3 russet potatoes, quartered and peeled</li>
<li>1 tbsp kosher salt</li>
<li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
<li>1 tsp dried rosemary</li>
<li>1 rounded tbsp dried oregano</li>
<li>Pinch of cayenne</li>
<li>6 cloves of garlic, freshly minced</li>

<li>2/3 cup chicken broth (for deglazing)</li>

<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Put the chicken into a mixing bowl.
Season with salt, pepper, rosemary, oregano, cayenne, and garlic.
Add the lemon juice, oil, and potatoes and mix thoroughly by hand.
Cover and sit in fridge for a few hours (or use immediately).</p></li>

<li><p>Transfer the mixture into a lightly-oiled large roasting pan, making sure that the chicken is evenly distributed and skin-side up.
Add a &frac12; cup of water or chicken broth.
Spoon the remaining marinade over the chicken and potatoes.</p></li>

<li><p>Transfer the pan into the center of a 425 Â°F oven and cook for 45 minutes.
At the 15 and 30 minutes, remove the pan and toss the potatoes/chicken in the pan drippings with a pair of tongs.
Make sure that the chicken goes back into the oven skin-side up.</p></li>

<li><p>After 45 minutes, take the pan out of the oven and put the chicken pieces on another plate/pan.
Cover them to keep warm.
Turn the oven to broil/hottest, toss the potatoes in the drippings one last time, and put the pan back in the oven to crisp up the potatoes (~5 minutes).</p></li>

<li><p>Remove the pan one last time, splash with the remaining water/chicken broth, strain the left-over liquid, and spoon over the chicken and potatoes.</p></li>

<li><p>Garnish with freshly chopped oregano (optional).</p></li>
</ol>
